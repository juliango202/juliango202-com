      <h2>I'm currently available for a job</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! I'm a French full stack developer with a deep experience covering a variety of languages and domains.
        Here is <a href="/resume.pdf">my resume</a> and a <a href="/projects">list of past projects</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am blessed to work in a time where experienced software developers are in high demand, so hopefully
        I can afford to be a little picky. My ideal job would be:
        <ul>
        <li>
          Interesting work, currently my top 3 interests are: 1) self-driving cars, 2) AI &amp; deep learning, 3) financial industry.
          Bonus points for high impacts work(i.e. lots of users)
        </li>
        <li>
          A strong engineering culture. It means engineering is a top-priority for the company, with a lot of resources
          devoted to recruit and retain good engineers, and an avoidance to use consultant shops. It means taking the time to
          do things reliably and efficiently instead of focusing on short-term deadlines(may not apply to proof of concept works, or
          early stage startups). It means having reliable and ready-to-use components for transverse tasks like
          logins, sharing data, monitoring,... instead of reinventing the wheel for each project.
        </li>
        <li>
          A good compensation plan: stock-options plan for start-ups, competitive salary for established companies.
          Performance-based reviews and bonuses are welcome.
        </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
      If you have something along those lines I'd be glad to hear from you at <a href="mailto:juliango202@gmail.com">juliango202@gmail.com</a>.
      I am willing to relocate for the right job.
      </p>
